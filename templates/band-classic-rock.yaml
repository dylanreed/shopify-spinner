# Theme notes for manual customization:
# - Content framed like concert posters with borders and worn edges
# - Fade-in with slight blur animations (like photographs developing)
# - Paper grain texture on backgrounds
# - Slight sepia shift on product images
# - Subtle rounded corners, nothing sharp or digital
# - Timeless editorial feel, like flipping through liner notes
