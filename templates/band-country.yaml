# Theme notes for manual customization:
# - Full-width image bands like driving through landscapes
# - Slide-in from sides animation (like swinging saloon doors)
# - Worn/distressed edge treatment on cards and images
# - Open, spacious layout with big sky energy
# - Mix of sharp signage shapes and worn-rounded furniture edges
# - Genuine, straightforward aesthetic that shakes your hand firm
