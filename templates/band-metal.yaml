# Theme notes for manual customization:
# - Use vertical columns like cathedral pillars to divide content
# - Elements should emerge from shadow (opacity reveals)
# - Add cracked stone/concrete texture on hover states
# - Pointed arches and broken geometries throughout
# - Heavy, oppressive feel with deliberate negative space
