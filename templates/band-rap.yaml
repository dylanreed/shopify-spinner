# Theme notes for manual customization:
# - Large typography as design element, words become visuals
# - Slide-up with slight scale animation (confident entrance)
# - Strategic emptiness, luxury uses space deliberately
# - Sharp rectangles, hard edges, nothing soft
# - Occasional spray-paint texture or drip on accent elements
# - Commanding presence, minimal words maximum impact
