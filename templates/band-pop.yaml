# Theme notes for manual customization:
# - Bento grid layout with uneven card sizes, some cards "pop" forward
# - Elements bounce in with overshoot easing
# - Buttons pulse on hover
# - Scanline texture overlay on images (CRT monitor nostalgia)
# - Rounded rectangles, pill shapes, chunky borders
# - Y2K aesthetic meets high fashion
