# Theme notes for manual customization:
# - Asymmetric layouts like items arranged naturally on a porch
# - Gentle fade animations, no bounce or overshoot
# - Cross-stitch or quilt pattern as section dividers
# - Generous margins and room to breathe
# - Organic, handcrafted edges, nothing perfectly geometric
# - Unhurried, real, handmade feeling throughout
